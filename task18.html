    <h1>SCROLL MARGIN PROPERTY</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as the scripting language
        for web pages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side
         developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library
          of objects, like Array , date and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators , control structures, and statements.
        JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used
        for making web pages interactive. It allows you to implement complex features
        on web pages, such as handling user interactions, manipulating the DOM
        (Document Object Model), and making asynchronous requests to servers.
